        "<p>Thank you for choosing our ArbitrageXpert package. We assure you it's a decision that will prove worthwhile. Before you dive into finding lucrative arbitrage opportunities, let us reassure you: arbitrage betting is completely legal and a legitimate way to capitalize on market inefficiencies.</p>\n",
        "<p>**Instructions:**</p>\n",
        "<p>1. **Review the Live Data:**\n",
        "   Once you've finished reading these instructions, take a look at the live data below. You'll find various arbitrage opportunities listed, each showing profit margins, associated sportsbooks, and other pertinent details.</p>\n",
        "<p>2. **Choosing a Match:**\n",
        "   - Identify opportunities with higher profit margins—they offer greater potential returns.\n",
        "   - Consider the timing of the match. Rapidly changing odds in live or imminent games mean swift action is crucial to secure profitable bets.\n",
        "   - Focus on major sports leagues. Sportsbooks may restrict or ban users exploiting arbitrage in lesser-known leagues.\n",
        "   - Ensure the selected sportsbooks operate legally in your region. Some platforms may be restricted based on local regulations.</p>\n",
        "<p>3. **Placing Your Bets:**\n",
        "   - Opt for rounded odds when placing bets. This minimizes the risk of detection by sportsbooks, who may limit accounts engaging in arbitrage with non-rounded numbers.\n",
        "   - Note that rounding may slightly skew potential winnings towards one outcome. However, rest assured that our selections are strategically chosen to ensure profitability regardless of the match's outcome. Detailed graphs below illustrate this balance.</p>\n",
        "<p>\n",
        "4. **Final Steps:**\n",
        "   - Once bets are placed, your part is complete! Enjoy the game and await the outcome.\n",
        "   - After the match, simply cash out your winnings.</p>\n",
        "<p>We sincerely appreciate your trust in ArbitrageXpert. Should you have any questions or need assistance, our support team is here to help. Remember, this process becomes straightforward once you familiarize yourself with it.</p>\n",
